# First exposure to RabbitMQ
please note, to run this on your machine, you will have to have installed Erlang and RabbitMQ
This is basically just the tutorial, with a bit of spice, from https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/tutorial-one-java.html
I highly recommend doing this tutorial on your own. It is great practice for the first exposure to rabbitMQ
